An online forum for coding bootcamp students to share learning resources and prospective employers to post their job listings and connect with students.

## Description

A community of coding bootcamp students and employers looking to hire new developers. Bootcamper students can share learning resources with each other and apply to job posts. Company representatives can list their job opprtunities here and connect with bootcampers.

## Technology used

<b>Built with</b>
-React
Javascript library used to build the frontend client of the application. Primarily built with functional components and react hooks.

-Express and Node.js
Framework used to build the backend server of the application. Models and routes serve as an API for the client.
